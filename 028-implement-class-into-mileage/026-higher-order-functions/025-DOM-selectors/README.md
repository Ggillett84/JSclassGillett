# where do I think the class would go

I do not think I can code this and you said if we cant to just respond to where we think it might go. I think it mu=ight go with the gallons, price miles. I think that it would be a way to put tose in a class and use them around. I have a question though, do we make these private? or would we want to? is it goot practice to _on everything?
