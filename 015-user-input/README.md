# week 8

I have had issues with forms where the input has to be specific but isnt satated on the page on how to enter it. I have been locked out of things trying to figure out how it wants me to put in the information.
I think we want to run a do while code to calculate the answer the user is looking for. 

When you were entering 
   # FORM.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
   # e.preventDefault ()
   # trackMPGandCost(e.target.miles.value, e.target.gallons.value, e.target.price.value)
    in the week 8 mileage form works part 3, you didnt put "value" in the end of your "e.target.price". I did and the form worked for me. is the const ... = parseInt () really better if the shorter one worked? 

    It is hard for me to understand. As soon as I start getting something a new thing is introduced. I will keep playing with the codes though and I know I will get it in the end. 

    oh and really quick, on the video you say to make the last file of playing around as 016, but on the assingments you have instruct us to make it  015-playing-with-form. I am going to go with what you wrote down on canvas.
