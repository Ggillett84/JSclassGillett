# week 7 loops and arrays
I have been using the DevTools and I am getting more and more every time, but I feel like I should know more. I have been able to find my mistakes and I have been able to follow along with the step by step function in the debugger mode. But the little side things like the scope and call stack I am still getting to understand. 

I feel like I am struggling with it. I am able to find my mistakes and correct them, but I am not sure I can do this without help. I was so good with HTML and CSS, so this is really bringing me down. i hope its normal to feel like this. 
on the last video i got really confused, but the code DID look better. I am having trouble learning more than one way at a time. I know there ARE more than one way to do this stuff, but for my learning abbilities, I am not getting a chance to grasp any concept. 
Is the "i" for indext the only letter you can use?
whats the diffrence when you put "const calculateSUM = (arr)" V. "const calculateSUM = ()"
I had more questions, some I answered as I was learning along with you, others I forgot. I need to just jump in the README and put them in so I dont forget.
