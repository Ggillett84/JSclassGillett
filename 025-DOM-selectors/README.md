# how I tried to fix the code
For the HTML I put step=".01" so that it could take 2 digits after a decimal.
for the JAVA I would think that you can put toFixed(2) after miles, price, and gallons in the code. I will watch and see what you did now

# after watching you fix the code
I got the HTML right (except I limited it to two numbers after a decimal), and I got the toFixed idea, but I knew I would not be able to place it in the right part of the code. I was right. 

# which DOM selector and where would the code go

I would use the queryselector on the event listener for the bottons. I did something but it ony disables my submit button after I have presse the delete button.
