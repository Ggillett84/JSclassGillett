# what I know about JSON and local storage

It can take strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, arrays,and objects. The code is very similar to JS except you have to use " with all of your diffrent keys . You can create a JSON file with a .json at the end. its a string with only properties and no methods. must be converted to jS object with json.parse. its lightweight

thats what I learned so far

# How clear is it for me?

It is clear that we have to make it into a string and pass it back in. I am getting lots of it, its just when I have to code I get stuck. Like I didnt think of making a function for the localStorage.setItem('tripdata', JSON.stringify (MY_DATA)).....
