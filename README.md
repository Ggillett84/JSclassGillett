# Week 6 Video 1 My Thoughts
So far I am comfortable with these changes. I am still having the same issues with my files staying green
showing that they are not saved. Apparently they are getting sent to github, but just not saving on VS.
I think I will need to meet and share my screen with you to figure this out. I work full time at the Clovis hospital, and I have a 3 year old. I will figure out a time though. Thank you and its nice to see you in the videos.
