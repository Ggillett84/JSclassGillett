# Week 8 form validation

I Think I get it.... if miles = 0 it runs the console log of error message but anythin  ELSE  it runs the trackMPGandCost. is that right?

for the validation and coding challenge, I was not able to do either. I tried with the average, but for some reason my price was not declared with a value. I did the best that I could. 
As for the other challenge of taking the code off I could not understand wht I was reading. I'm sorry.

so I did my atempt before I did my first commit. but here it is again. 

on your solution you started your video with all of the code for the solution already in.... I feel like it should have been like a code with me video as I was not able to see your code that made the outcome you had. I got some of it but as I went on it just messed everything up. its really hard to understand what you are talking about when its all coded alreay. can you look at my code and see where I missed something? I would say i need to see you code.
