# Week 8 form validation

I Think I get it.... if miles = 0 it runs the console log of error message but anythin  ELSE  it runs the trackMPGandCost. is that right?

for the validation and coding challenge, I was not able to do either. I tried with the average, but for some reason my price was not declared with a value. I did the best that I could. 
As for the other challenge of taking the code off I could not understand wht I was reading. I'm sorry.

so I did my atempt before I did my first commit. but here it is again.
