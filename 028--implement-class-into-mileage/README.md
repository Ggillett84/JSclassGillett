I accidentally deleted my file 020 and had to create a new one I was able to push my code "my attempt" it is just not in this one. 

# What broke and how can we fix it?

the edit broke and I think its because it doesnt match the way it is written in the new class. we put an underscore and it doesnt match awhere the error is. I really have no idea why its giving me NaN as an answer though.
