I accidentally deleted my file 020 and had to create a new one I was able to push my code "my attempt" it is just not in this one. 

# What broke and how can we fix it?

the edit broke and I think its because it doesnt match the way it is written in the new class. we put an underscore and it doesnt match awhere the error is. I really have no idea why its giving me NaN as an answer though. 

# not working solution
sso as I mentioned I have had to redo thos 028 file and for some reason I had old code in and it was not working. I had it working and then I dont know what happened. I ended up undoing everything until it was back to the Nan. I just took the underscores off of the trip.js code. it still sends a Nan though.
