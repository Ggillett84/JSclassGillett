Sorry, just coded until the end and forgot to stop and commit. Im all over the board right now just tring to get it done for a passing grade. 

# my thoughts on the last commit
this was so much fun. I had a few errors on my side and the dev tools helped me find them so that I could get working code. This is so much fun though.
