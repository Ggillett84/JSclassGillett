I am starting to understand it, but like I said... it is very advanced for me. on my last 2 commits I noticed that me code to update the dom for    
 updateDOM(`Average MPG is ${avgMPG}`, '#output-avg')
 updateDOM(`Average Trip Cost is ${avgTripCost}`, '#output-avg')
 were not coming up. I tried to figure out why, but I had no success. WEEK 10 LOOKS SCARY LOL
 I do like the idea of creating a CRUD on my own, however it will be a lot more simple than what we have been through. I wish it had been like this from the begining. I cant always get help because I work full time and have kids, so my homework time is between midnight and 4am (after I get home from work). I wish this was an in peerson class....I really love coding and I actually deam about it when I get it. sorry I am failing in this class, I wish you could see my HTML CSS work from that class.... oh I love coding. I will get it, this is just so fast and diffrent for me. Thank you for all that you do
