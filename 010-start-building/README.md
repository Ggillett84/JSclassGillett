# Are you using devTools?
Yes I am using the devTools. So far I am not really getting it, but I am learning every time. I know it will be helpful in the future, so I will not give up. 

# Does this Array concept make sense to you?

Yes it does. I am going to need to play with it a bit more, but I can see it working with devToold and that helps a lot.
