# Are you using devTools?
Yes I am using the devTools. So far I am not really getting it, but I am learning every time. I know it will be helpful in the future, so I will not give up. 

# Does this Array concept make sense to you?

Yes it does. I am going to need to play with it a bit more, but I can see it working with devToold and that helps a lot. 

# Did you noticed there was NO update to the DOM on the code after I included the array example????  First see if you can fix the code to have it update the DOM! Were you successful? Also did notice that my tripCost was not correct? Were you able to fix these issues?

I did notice that it was not updated to the DOM, but I thought...oh maybe its just a code for the console... 
I was not able to fix it on my own, but once i went along with you I was able to see that I had mistakes in my milage function. I did not notice that your trip cost was not correct, darn, I usually catch these kind of things. I ran my code and eveything is correct now. Thank you!
