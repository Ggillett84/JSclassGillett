# higher order function
takes a function as a parameter or returns as a function
a function takes a parameter to perform an oporation on it or with it. 

setTimeout for example needs a function to tell it what to do. functions are a commands telling it what to do 
rep is a red flag and this helps to fix it
first order functions are smaller

function factories are something I want to learn more about.
